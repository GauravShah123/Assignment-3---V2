        <p>I was recently recommended the book “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie. I can’t
            explain how much this book shifted my perspective on relationships and communication. Here is a quick list
            of everything I learnt.</p>
        <h2>Part 1 - Introduction</h2>
        <h3>Criticism is futile</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Positive reinforcement is more effective than criticism.</li>
            <li>Understand others' justifications and calmly explain yours.</li>
            <li>Wrongdoers often believe they are right.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Appreciation and Praise</h3>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Be generous with praise and sparing with criticism.</li>
            <li>Be sincere and avoid flattery.</li>
            <li>Notice and point out people's good qualities.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>What they want matters</h3>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Appeal to what others care about, not just what you care about.</li>
            <li>When requesting or negotiating, consider what would make them want to agree.</li>
            <li>Help them envision the positive results of the change you propose.</li>
            </ul></p>
            <h3>Enthusiasm is key</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>People mirror the emotions you show them.</li>
                    <li>Display energy and enthusiasm to evoke the same response in others.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Part 2 - Being more likeable</h2>
            <h3>Be more interested in other people</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Show thoughtfulness without being performative.</li>
                    <li>Remember important dates like birthdays and reach out.</li>
                    <li>Take an interest in their passions and learn from them.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Smile</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A smile conveys happiness and leaves a positive impression.</li>
                    <li>It brings happiness to others and improves their perception of you.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Remember first names</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Names are important to people and make them feel valued.</li>
                    <li>Mispronouncing or misspelling names can have a negative effect.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Be an attentive listener</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encourage others to talk about themselves.</li>
                    <li>Show genuine interest and ask enjoyable questions.</li>
                    <li>Especially effective when dealing with angry customers.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Talk in terms of their interests</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn about topics others are passionate about.</li>
                    <li>Engage in discussions, even if it's not your own passion.</li>
                    <li>Show energy and enthusiasm during conversations.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Be nice</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Display common courtesy and politeness.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Part 3 - How to influence people</h2>
            <h3>You can't win an argument</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid arguments to maintain goodwill.</li>
                    <li>Agree with others to prevent unnecessary conflict.</li>
                    <li>Help others feel a sense of importance.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Step 1: Welcome the disagreement</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disagreement is valuable for growth and improvement.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Step 2: Disregard your first instinct</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid getting defensive or angry during disagreements.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Step 3: Listen first</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Listening shows respect and can prevent mistakes.</li>
                    <li>Disagreement often stems from a passion for the topic.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Step 4: Postpone</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allow time for reflection before continuing the discussion.</li>
                    <li>Consider the merit and importance of the disagreement.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Step 5: Disarm</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Avoid announcing the intention to change others' minds.</li>
                    <li>Phrase statements in a way that encourages joint examination of facts.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Never say "you're wrong"</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Directly stating someone is wrong diminishes their self-esteem.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Admit if you are wrong (quickly and emphatically)</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Apologize before being confronted.</li>
                    <li>Admitting mistakes disarms others and increases forgiveness.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Get them saying yes at the start</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start with points of agreement to establish rapport.</li>
                    <li>Priming others to say "yes" makes further agreement more likely.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Let people think it was their idea</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask others for their input to make them feel involved.</li>
                    <li>Help them arrive at your desired outcome without resistance.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Think from their perspective</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider why others hold their beliefs.</li>
                    <li>Show how your perspective benefits them.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Appeal to their noble motives</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognize and appreciate the noble aspects of others.</li>
                    <li>Make them aware of their positive qualities to gain compliance.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Dramatize your ideas</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use vivid language and creativity to make conversations engaging.</li>
                    <li>Incorporate gamification or friendly competition when appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            </p>
            <h3>Talk about your mistakes before criticizing others</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Show that the goal is to improve the work, not belittle others.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Ask questions, don't give orders</h3>
