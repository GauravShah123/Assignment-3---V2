        <p>Understanding how our brains work is essential for creating great user experiences. In this blog article, I
            want to explore some fascinating psychology concepts about memory and understand how they relate to everyday
            UX design.</p>
        <h2>Short-Term Memory Capacity</h2>
        <p>Our short-term memory can only hold around 5 to 9 pieces of information at once. This has big implications
            for UX design. When we present information to users, we need to avoid overwhelming them with too much
            content on one screen. Instead, breaking it into smaller, manageable parts with clear headings or bullet
            points helps users remember and understand better.</p>
        <h3>Have you ever noticed?</h3>
        <p>Mobile apps frequently employ navigation bars or tab bars at the bottom of the screen to provide easy access
            to essential features. By limiting the number of visible options and presenting them at the user's
            fingertips, the design prevents information overload and allows users to recall the app's core functions
            quickly.</p>
        <h2>Primacy and Recency Effects</h2>
        <p>People tend to remember the first and last pieces of information they encounter. In UX, this means we should
            put important information at the beginning and end of user journeys. This way, users are more likely to
            remember and act on it.</p>
        <h3>Have you ever noticed?</h3>
        <p>In content-heavy websites or apps, designers use the Primacy Effect to showcase the most critical content or
            headline at the top of the page. This grabs users' attention and encourages them to continue reading. The
            Recency Effect can be observed when designers end an article or page with a compelling conclusion or
            call-to-action, leaving users with a lasting impression.</p>
        <h2>Recognition vs. Recall</h2>
        <p>Recognition memory is stronger than recall memory. So, we should use visual cues and familiar elements in UX
            design to help users recognize things easily. Familiar icons and consistent designs make the user experience
            smoother.</p>
        <h3>Have you ever noticed?</h3>
        <p>Mobile app icons are designed to leverage recognition memory. Icons often represent the app's functionality
            or brand identity, allowing users to recognize and locate their desired app quickly amidst a sea of other
            icons, without the need for recalling the app's name.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>These principles are just the tip of the iceberg. In the future, I plan to explore more psychology concepts
            and their impact on UX design. Understanding human psychology is key to creating interfaces that users will
            love and remember.</p>
